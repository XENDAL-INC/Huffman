# Huffman Encoding in C++

Huffman Encoding in C++ is a command-line application that allows you to compress and decompress files using the Huffman coding algorithm. The application is built using C++ and does not use any external libraries.

## Introduction

Huffman encoding is a lossless data compression algorithm that uses variable-length codes to represent symbols in a file. The algorithm works by assigning shorter codes to symbols that occur more frequently and longer codes to symbols that occur less frequently. This allows the algorithm to achieve higher compression ratios than traditional fixed-length encoding methods.

## Usage

To use Huffman Encoding in C++, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the application using the following command:
4. To compress a file, run the following command:
This will compress the input file using Huffman encoding and save the result to the output file.

5. To decompress a file, run the following command:
This will decompress the input file using Huffman encoding and save the result to the output file.

## Limitations

While Huffman Encoding in C++ is a powerful tool for compressing and decompressing files, it does have some limitations. For example:

- The application only works with text files.
- The compression ratio may not always be optimal for very small files.
- The compression ratio may be affected by the distribution of symbols in the file.

## Conclusion

Huffman Encoding in C++ is a useful tool for compressing and decompressing files using the Huffman coding algorithm. If you have any questions or suggestions for improvements, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
